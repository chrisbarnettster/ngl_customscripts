 - For your interactive structure - dont worry about putting the static modifications on.
 -  What is important is to show the three ajoene modifications: 108, 367 and 687. The 687 modification is the one we will make a big deal about.
 - It would be good if you could also show the phosphorylation sites which are NB for activity at Tyr705, Ser727 and Thr 714. We found ajoene partially inhibits phosphorylation of Tyr705 so this is especially NB.
 - Then it would also be good if you could highlight the TAD region which is the business end of the protein from 690-end (770). The modified cysteine 687 is in this region whereas the other modified cysteines are not.
 - *Can we actually put ball and stick covalent modifications of Cys-S-S-allyl (for ajoene) and phosphoryation Tyr-O-PO32- (for phosphorylation)? I suppose we are using artistic licence and dont really know how the protein moves with these modifications. Otherwhise just highlight sites - not sure what you think.*
